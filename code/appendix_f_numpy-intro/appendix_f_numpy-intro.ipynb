    "This appendix offers a quick tour of the NumPy library for working with multi-dimensional arrays in Python. NumPy (short for Numerical Python) was created by Travis Oliphant in 2005, by merging Numarray into Numeric. Since then, the open source NumPy library has evolved into an essential library for scientific computing in Python and has become a building block of many other scientific libraries, such as SciPy, scikit-learn, pandas, and others.\n",
    "What makes NumPy so particularly attractive to the scientific community is that it provides a convenient Python interface for working with multi-dimensional array data structures efficiently; the NumPy array data structure is also called `ndarray`, which is short for *n*-dimensional array. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to being mostly implemented in C and using Python as glue, the main reason why NumPy is so efficient for numerical computations is that NumPy arrays use contiguous blocks of memory that can be efficiently cached by the CPU. In contrast, Python lists are arrays of pointers to objects in random locations in memory, which cannot be easily cached and come with a more expensive memory-look-up. However, the computational efficiency and low-memory footprint come at a cost: NumPy arrays have a fixed size and are homogenous, which means that all elements must have the same type. Homogenous `ndarray` objects have the advantage that NumPy can carry out operations using efficient C loops and avoid expensive type checks and other overheads of the Python API. While adding and removing elements from the end of a Python list is very efficient, altering the size of a NumPy array is very expensive since it requires to create a new array and carry over the contents of the old array that we want to expand or shrink. \n",
    "\n",
    "Besides being more efficient for numerical computations than native Python code, NumPy can also be more elegant and readable due to vectorized operations and broadcasting, which are features that we will explore in this appendix. While this appendix should be sufficient to follow the code examples in this book if you are new to NumPy, there are many advanced NumPy topics that are beyond the scope of this book. If you are interested in a more in-depth coverage of NumPy, I selected a few resources that could be useful to you:\n",

    "NumPy is built around [`ndarrays`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html) objects, which are high-performance multi-dimensional array data structures. Intuitively, we can think of a one-dimensional NumPy array as a data structure to represent a vector of elements -- you may think of it as a fixed-size Python list where all elements share the same type. Similarly, we can think of a two-dimensional array as a data structure to represent a matrix or a Python list of lists. While NumPy arrays can have up to 32 dimensions if it was compiled without alterations to the source code, we will focus on lower-dimensional arrays for the purpose of illustration in this introduction.\n",
